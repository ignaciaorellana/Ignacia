I’m a service designer, working in the public sector. Currently at [Government Digital Service.](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service)

I help organisations find the best way to meet the needs of their users, by applying my knowledge of user centred design and current technologies.

I design services that work across all channels and are inclusive of all users. I look for cost-effective, sustainable solutions - reusing or adapting existing work where possible.

I’m very active in the government design community, where my focus is on building capability and improving diversity and inclusion. I deliver service design training, support and mentor colleagues, blog and speak at conferences.

I love collaborating with and learning from others - designing and facilitating workshops that bring people together to create better, more user centred and accessible public services.
