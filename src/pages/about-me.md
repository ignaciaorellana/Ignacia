I’m a service designer, working in the public sector. Currently at [Government Digital Service.](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service)

I help organisations find the best way to meet the needs of their users, by applying my knowledge of user centred design and current technologies.

I design services that work across all channels and are inclusive of all users. I look for cost-effective, sustainable solutions - reusing or adapting existing work where possible.

I’m very active in the government design community, where my focus is on building capability and improving diversity and inclusion. I deliver service design training, support and mentor colleagues, blog and speak at conferences.

I love collaborating with and learning from others - designing and facilitating workshops that bring people together to create better, more user centred and accessible public services.

**Service design, GOV.UK, Government Digital Service**\
August 2019 - Current



Working across various [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) brexit teams, with UCD and non UCD disciplines to bring those teams together (product managers, developers, content, user research, etc), share findings and insights and look at improving the end to end user journey to support people in preparing for Brexit. 



Providing better join-up amongst the product teams, by facilitating discussions through workshops, and making sure there are actionable things we can take forward and we reduce the duplication of work. 



**Service design, Service Communities, Government Digital Service**\
January 2019 - July 2019



A [service community](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/01/28/what-service-communities-are-achieving-across-government/) is a network of people from across the public sector who work together to design and deliver an end-to-end service. A service community provides a framework for collaboration that makes it easier to solve common challenges.



Our main objective over these 6 months was enabling people to set up service communities, removing dependencies on GDS and enabling the growth of communities within government.



Some of the things I did:

\- supported live service communities in co-designing and facilitating cross government workshops, bringing from policy maker to delivery and operations teams to work together.

\- supported the setting up of potential service communities

\- created a repository of tools, templates and workshop sessions based on the communities’ experiences, to establish best practices and standardised resources we could share with community managers. 

\- worked with other parts of GDS such as service assessments team and the digital engagement managers, to use the service assessments as a way to spot opportunity for service communities across government and join up services at an early stage.

\- co-written with my team guidance about [working across organisational boundaries](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/working-across-organisational-boundaries) in the Service Manual, informing and providing evidence for teams to meet the new updated Service Standard (points 2 & 3)

\- informed the new 2030 vision of GDS, collaborating with the Strategy & Engagement team. This has been framed as life events and the need for cross departmental working on services as users see them.



**Service design, Service Assessment improvements, Government Digital Service**\
November 2018 - December 2018

With the introduction of the new [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), there was an opportunity to significantly improve the way we ensure that service teams meet our standards. The challenge was to start bringing [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments) in line with the new service standard. This work was focused on identifying quick wins and a plan for further work. 



Some of the improvements were:

\- iteration the assessment report template, based on feedback from the assessor community after conducting user research 

\- providing clearer guidelines on what it means to be an assessor, to set expectations, and create something which head of communities across government can use to recruit people to become assessors

\- presented to senior stakeholders within GDS to playback findings, improvements and to help make the case to move this work forward

\- providing a report with main user research findings, recommendations, a roadmap and priorities of future work 



**Service design, GOV.UK Design System, Government Digital Service**\
September 2017 - December 2018





I was responsible for the service elements of the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), leading on the design of sustainable models for support, contribution, assurance and community development.



**Contribution** - I worked closely with Design System users to create a place for them to contribute ideas, share research and discuss components and patterns. I developed a simple model for making and supporting contributions, so that the process is clear for users and the team.

**Assurance** - I developed a fair and open process for reviewing contributions, to ensure that they are of a high quality and represent the needs of all users. New components and patterns are assured by an independent group of community representatives against published criteria. 

**Support** - I designed a multi-channel support model, taxonomy and tagging system. This allows the team to collect and analyse support data from Zendesk, GitHub and Slack in a single place and helps them identify emerging user needs and continuously improve their service.

**Community** - I helped develop the growing community of users and contributors to the GOV.UK Design System. I worked closely with heads of design, designers and developers in departments, to understand their different needs and empower them to shape the service they will be using.

**Outcomes:**

We’ve had around 70 people contributing to the patterns and components in our backlog on GitHub, sharing things that have been designed within service teams, and learnings from user research.

Of the 14 new components and patterns published since the service went public (June 2019), 11 of them were contributed by people outside of the team.

The team provides high level support to users and handles about 100 tickets a month across it's 3 main support channels (Zendesk, GitHub and Slack).
